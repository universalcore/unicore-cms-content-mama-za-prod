Fruits like apples and oranges are good. Get lots of them. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food with you if you have to go somewhere.\r\n\r\n 2. **Get check-ups** while you are pregnant. Try to have 5 visits to the clinic. Get your blood and urine (pee) tests and blood pressure checks done regularly. These tests help to find problems early. Then you can get treatment and keep yourself and your baby safe. \r\n\r\n 3. **Get tested for HIV**. If you are HIV+, there are medicines to help keep you well and prevent your baby from being born HIV+. If you find out you are not HIV+, you can make sure you stay that way.\r\n\r\n 4. **Take the pregnancy tablets the clinic gives you**. These tablets help your baby grow well. \r\n\r\n 5. **Keep clean**. Wash your hands with soap before cooking and eating and after using the toilet.\r\n",
